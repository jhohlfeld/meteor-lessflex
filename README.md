#Meteor lessflex

Adds a `less` file containing css declarations that help you to use flex layout.

##Installation

Install using

````bash
$ meteor install jhohlfeld:lessflex
````

Before that, install meteor-less doing

````bash
$ meteor install less
````

##Many thanks
Thanks to https://github.com/Polymer/layout/blob/master/layout.html

What I did is to simply take the css declarations from `Polymer/layout.html` and put them into a LESS-file.
